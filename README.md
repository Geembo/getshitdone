Get Shit Done
===========
### Simple todo app with Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js

Get shit done is a simple todo app developed using Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js. The main purpose is to showcase the process of developing with Backbone.js and make a proof of concept with the combination of both.

### Run the app

First, you need to clone the git repository.
```
git clone http://github.com/tsironis/getshitdone
```
or grab the ssh link above, if you use git with ssh.

Then, you need to start the Rails app.

```
cd getshitdone
rails s
```

If you are bored to get some data in there and you want to quickly see what's up with it, just run the following command.
```
rake db:seed
```

That's all folks! Many updates will follow soon.
